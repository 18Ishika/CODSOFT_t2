Iris Flower Classification
Overview

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on various features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory purposes.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is publicly available over kaggle. It contains the following features:

Sepal Length: Length of the sepal (in centimeters)

Sepal Width: Width of the sepal (in centimeters)

Petal Length: Length of the petal (in centimeters)

Petal Width: Width of the petal (in centimeters)

Species: Species of iris flower (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

Results
I achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set using the best performing model. Further details about the model performance, feature importance, and evaluation metrics are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

Conclusion
In this project, I successfully built machine learning models to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their features. Our analysis provides insights into the classification task and demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in solving such problems.
